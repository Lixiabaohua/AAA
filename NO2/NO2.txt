%real data analysis
Notes for data set: 8 column
C1: response, hourly values of the logarithm of the concentration of NO2(particles)
C2: logarithm of the number of cars per hour
C3:  temperature 2 meters above ground
C4:  wind spped
C5:  temperature differencebetween 25 and 2 meters above ground
C6:  wind direction
C7: U, hours of day
C8:   day number

resort this data set into a time series and 
select covariates: wind speed, log car numbers, and difference of temperature
covariates are transformed on [0,1]

Script:
NO2.m: main procedure generate Figure 4 and Figure 5 of this paper

Function:
mysort.m: resort orginal data in time order
rspline1.m, rspline2.m: generate Bspline matrix and its the first  derivative matrix
deriveSCAD.m: compute the value of SCAD penality function
StepIest.m: consstruct initial estimation of Step I
Spest.m: three-step spline estimators for full model with selected three covariates
myknot.m: select optimal knots in varying-coefficient additive function under specified order of
